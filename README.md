## About
EasyScotia is an in-built overlay of relevant information, easily accessible through a chrome extension. 
Our application automatically detects the page that the user is logged on and the main content information block within it provides banking clients with an interactive tutorial to perform their desired tasks and highlights elements on the page. 
It also provides easy access to Scotiabank help sections through the various icons that direct the client to the respective Scotiabank FAQ page if deemed necessary.
